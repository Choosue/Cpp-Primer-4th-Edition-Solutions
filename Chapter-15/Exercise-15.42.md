# Exercise 15.42

Design and implement one of the following enhancements:
a. Introduce support for evaluating words based on their presence within the same sentence rather than the same line.
b. Introduce a history system in which the user can refer to a previous query by number, possibly adding to it or combining it with another.
c. Rather than displaying the count of matches and all the matching lines, allow the user to indicate a range of lines to display, both for intermediate query evaluation and the final query.
