# Exercise 15.30

Explain any discrepancy in the amount generated by the previous two programs. If there is no discrepancy, explain why there isn't one.

**Answer**:

When we add objects that are of the derived type, only the base portion of the object is stored in the container. So that in the [Exercise 15.28](Exercise-15.28.md), we get output `89.95` for the second element, because its derived part is sliced down. However, given the same input, we get output `71.96` in the [Exercise 15.29](Exercise-15.29.md), because we only put pointers in the `vector`, the original object remains the same.
