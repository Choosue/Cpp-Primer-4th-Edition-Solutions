# Exercise 4.15

Explain the key differences between pointers and references.

**Answer**:

- A pointer holds the address of the object it points to , while a reference is just another name of the object.
- You can change the value of a pointer while remaining the value of the object it points to. When you change the value of a reference, you are changing the value of the object at the same time which means the reference is bind to the object once initialized.
