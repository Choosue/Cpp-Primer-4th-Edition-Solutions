# Exercise 11.8

We said that algorithms do not change the size of the containers over which they operate. Why doesn't the use of
`back_inserter` invalidate this claim?

**Answer**:

Because algorithms only cares about the iterator they operate on, it is the insert iterators generated by `back_iterator` that change the size of the containers not the algorithms.
