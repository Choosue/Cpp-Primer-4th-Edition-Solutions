# Exercise 7.36

What is a candidate function? What is a viable function?

**Answer**:

- Candidate function: A candidate function is a function with the same name as the function that is called and for which a declaration is visible at the point of the call.
- Viable function: A viable function must meet two tests. First, the function must have the same number of parameters as there are arguments in the call. Second, the type of each argument must match, or be convertible to, the type of its corresponding parameter.
