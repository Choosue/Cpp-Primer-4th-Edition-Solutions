# Exercise 6.16

Given two `vector`s of `int`s, write a program to determine whether one `vector`s is a prefix of the other. For `vector`s of unequal length, compare the number of elements of the smaller `vector`. For example, given the `vector`s(0,1,1,2) and (0,1,1,2,3,5,8), your program should return `true`.

**Answer**:
