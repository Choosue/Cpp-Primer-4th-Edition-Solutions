# Exercise 12.7

What is encapsulation? Why it is useful?

**Answer**:

Encapsulation is a term that describes the technique of combining lower-level elements to form a new, higher-level entity.

Data abstraction and encapsulation provide two important advantages:

- Class internals are protected from inadvertent user-level errors, which might corrupt the state of the object.
- The class implementation may evolve over time in response to changing requirements or bug reports without requiring change in user-level code.
