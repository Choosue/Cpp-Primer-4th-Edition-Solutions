# Best Practices

- If the class is defined with the `struct` keyword, then members defined before the first access label are `public`; if the class is defined using the class keyword, then the members are `private`.
- An incomplete type may be used to define only pointers or references to the type or to declare (but not define) functions that use the type as a paremeter or return type.
- The class must be defined before a reference or pointer is used to access a member of the type.
- A class is not defined until its class body is complete, a class cannot have data members of its own type. But can have data members that are pointers or references to its own type.
- Ordinarily, it is a bad idea to define an object as part of a class definition. Doing so obscures what's happening. It is confusing to readers to combine definitions of two different entities the class and a variable in a single statement.
- If the function is defined outside the class body, then the name used for the return type is outside the class scope.
- A name must be defined before it can be usedã€‚
- A constructor is used to initialize an object regardless of whether the object is `const`.
- The constructor initializer is specified only on the constructor definition, not its declaration.
- Conceptually, we can think of a constructor as executing in two phases: (1) the initialization phase and (2) a general computation phase. The computation phase consists of all the statements within the body of the constructor.
- We must use an initializer for any `const` or reference member or for any member of a class type that does not have a default constructor.
- The constructor initializer list specifies only the values used to initialize the members, **not the order** in which those initializations are performed. So, it is a good idea to write constructor initializers in the same order as the members are declared. Moreover, when possible, avoid using members to initialize other members.
