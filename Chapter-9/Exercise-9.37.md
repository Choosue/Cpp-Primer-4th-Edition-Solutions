# Exercise 9.37

Given that you want to read a character at a time into a `string`, and you know that the data you need to read is at least 100 characters long, how might you improve the performance of your program?

**Answer**:

If I have already known that the string is 100 characters long, I would first initialize an empty `string` with 100 capacity.
