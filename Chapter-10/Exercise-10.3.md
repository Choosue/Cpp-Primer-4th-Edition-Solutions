# Exercise 10.3

Describe the differences between an associative container and a sequential container.

**Answer**:

1. The elements are accessed in key order in an associative container. The elements are accessed in the order in which the elements were placed in the sequential container.
2. Associative containers support efficient lookup and retrieval by a key, while sequential containers do not.
3. The elements in associative containers are key-value pairs. The elements in sequential containers are primitive types or user defined types.
