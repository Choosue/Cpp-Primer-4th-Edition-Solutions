# Exercise 10.22

Explain the difference between a `set` and a `list`. When might you use one or the other?

**Answer**:

`set` supports fast determination of the existence for a given key, while `list` supports fast inserting or deleting of elements at rear or middle of the list.

- `set` case: eliminating duplicate elements.
- `list` case: sorting elements.
